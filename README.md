## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized location for storing and managing development prompts that can be used with:
- AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Code review processes
- Team onboarding and training
- Development guidelines documentation
- Quality assurance workflows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Individual Prompts

Navigate to the relevant category and copy the prompt that fits your needs:

1. **Code Quality**: Use [`code-quality/production-standards.md`](code-quality/production-standards.md) to ensure your code meets enterprise standards
2. **Code Review**: Apply [`code-review/review-checklist.md`](code-review/review-checklist.md) during code reviews
3. **Debugging**: Follow [`debugging/troubleshooting.md`](debugging/troubleshooting.md) for systematic issue resolution
4. **Testing**: Implement [`testing/test-strategy.md`](testing/test-strategy.md) for comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Use [`documentation/documentation-guide.md`](documentation/documentation-guide.md) for clear documentation
6. **Architecture**: Apply [`architecture/design-principles.md`](architecture/design-principles.md) for system design
7. **Security**: Follow [`security/security-checklist.md`](security/security-checklist.md) for secure code

### Example Usage

When working with AI coding assistants:

```
[Copy the content from code-quality/production-standards.md]

Now, help me implement a user authentication service.
```
