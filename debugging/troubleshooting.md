# Debugging and Troubleshooting Prompt

Help me debug this issue by following a systematic approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - What is the expected behavior?
   - What is the actual behavior?
   - When did this issue start occurring?
   - Can you reproduce the issue consistently?

2. **Gather Information**:
   - Error messages and stack traces
   - Log files and relevant output
   - Environment details (OS, versions, configuration)
   - Recent changes to the codebase

3. **Analyze**:
   - Identify potential root causes
   - Review related code sections
   - Check for common issues (null references, race conditions, etc.)

4. **Hypothesize**:
   - Form theories about what might be causing the issue
   - Prioritize theories based on likelihood

5. **Test**:
   - Create minimal reproducible examples
   - Add logging/debugging statements
   - Test hypotheses systematically

6. **Fix**:
   - Implement the fix
   - Verify the fix resolves the issue
   - Ensure no regressions are introduced

7. **Document**:
   - Document the root cause
   - Document the solution
   - Add comments if the fix is not obvious
