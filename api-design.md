# Code Generation Prompt (Enterprise Quality)

When generating new code, you **must** follow these rules:

## 1. Code Quality
- Code must be **production-ready** and **enterprise-grade**.  
- Must be efficient, maintainable, secure, and scalable.  

## 2. Principles
- Follow **SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Clean Code, and OOP** principles.  
- Prioritize readability and simplicity.  

## 3. Relevance
- Only generate what is explicitly asked for.  
- Avoid unnecessary features, optimizations, or improvements.  

## 4. Tests
- Provide **only essential tests** when required.  
- Keep them concise and focused on critical functionality.  

## 5. Output
- Deliver only the requested code.  
- No unrelated refactoring or suggestions.
